EXTRA IFACE OPTIONS

       Usually  someone  who  uses  vlans  also  wants  to   do   some   other
       manipulations with the ip stack or interface.

       vlan-raw-device devicename
              Indicates  the  device  to  create the vlan on.  This is ignored
              when the devicename is part of the vlan interface name.

       ip-proxy-arp 0|1
              Turn proxy-arp off or on for this specific interface.  This also
              works on plain ethernet like devices.

       ip-rp-filter 0|1|2
              Set  the  return  path filter for this specific interface.  This
              also works on plain ethernet like devices.

       hw-mac-address mac-address
              This sets the mac address of the interface  before  bringing  it
              up.   This  works on any device that allows setting the hardware
              address with the ip command.

	#Installation
	#ifenslave is used to attach and detach slave network interfaces to a bonding device.

	sudo apt-get install ifenslave

	#Interface Configuration
	#Edit your interfaces configuration:

	 sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
	#For example, to combine eth0 and eth1 as slaves to your bonding interface:

	 auto eth0
	 iface eth0 inet manual
	   bond-master bond0

	 auto eth1
	 iface eth1 inet manual
	   bond-master bond0

	 auto bond0
	 iface bond0 inet static
	   address 192.168.1.10
	   gateway 192.168.1.1
	   netmask 255.255.255.0

	What happens:

	'auto bond0.911' starts setting up the interface.
	'pre-up' calls bondingstate
	bondingstate tests whether the bonding module is loaded,
	then starts bonding, if need be.
	'iface bond0' enslaves the physical NICs, then returns success
	bondingstate adds the given vlan ID and returns success
	'auto bond0.911' configures IP-addresses and returns success

	Configuring additional links is but a copy of 'bond0.911'

	On shutdown, 'post-down /etc/network/bondingstate DOWN bond0 911'
	calls bondingstate, which in turn checks in /etc/network/run/ifstate
	whether this is the last vlan interface and if so, shuts down bond0
	bond0's post-down then will remove the kernel module

	There might be routing issues. Beware of the order in /etc/network/interfaces.
---
	Ethernet Bonding modes
	Ethernet bonding has different modes you can use. You specify the mode for your bonding interface in /etc/network/interfaces. For example:


	bond-mode active-backup
	Descriptions of bonding modes
	Mode 0
	balance-rr

	Round-robin policy: Transmit packets in sequential order from the first available slave through the last. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

	Mode 1
	active-backup

	Active-backup policy: Only one slave in the bond is active. A different slave becomes active if, and only if, the active slave fails. The bond's MAC address is externally visible on only one port (network adapter) to avoid confusing the switch. This mode provides fault tolerance. The primary option affects the behavior of this mode.

	Mode 2
	balance-xor

	XOR policy: Transmit based on [(source MAC address XOR'd with destination MAC address) modulo slave count]. This selects the same slave for each destination MAC address. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

	Mode 3
	broadcast

	Broadcast policy: transmits everything on all slave interfaces. This mode provides fault tolerance.

	Mode 4
	802.3ad

	IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation. Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings. Utilizes all slaves in the active aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification.

	Prerequisites:

	Ethtool support in the base drivers for retrieving the speed and duplex of each slave.
	A switch that supports IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation. Most switches will require some type of configuration to enable 802.3ad mode.
	Mode 5
	balance-tlb

	Adaptive transmit load balancing: channel bonding that does not require any special switch support. The outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load (computed relative to the speed) on each slave. Incoming traffic is received by the current slave. If the receiving slave fails, another slave takes over the MAC address of the failed receiving slave.

	Prerequisites:

	Ethtool support in the base drivers for retrieving the speed of each slave.
	Mode 6
	balance-alb

	Adaptive load balancing: includes balance-tlb plus receive load balancing (rlb) for IPV4 traffic, and does not require any special switch support. The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation. The bonding driver intercepts the ARP Replies sent by the local system on their way out and overwrites the source hardware address with the unique hardware address of one of the slaves in the bond such that different peers use different hardware addresses for the server.
